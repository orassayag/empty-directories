## Instructions

===================
FAST & BASIC START.
===================
1. Open the project in IDE (Current to 11/04/2021 I'm using VSCode).
2. Open the following file in the src/settings/settings.js file.
3. Search for setting 'SCAN_PATH' - Select the path you want to scan.
4. You can control which paths to ignore in the 'configurations/ignorePaths.js' file.
5. Next - Time to install the NPM packages. In the terminal run 'npm i'. It will install automatically all the required NPM packages.
6. In the terminal run 'npm start'. If everything goes well, you will start to see the console status line appear.
7. If you see any error - Need to check what's changed. Current to 11/04/2021, it works fine.
8. If you see the console status line but the 'Total' not progressing - Need to check what's wrong.
9. If no errors and the progress works OK, make sure to check on 'dist' that the TXT file was created successfully.
10. Successful running application on production should look like this:

/* cSpell:disable */
